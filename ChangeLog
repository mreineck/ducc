0.8.0:
- general:
  - compiles and runs on MacOS 11
  - choice of various optimization and debugging levels by setting
    the DUCC0_OPTIMIZATION variable before compilation.
    Valid choices are
    "none":
      no optimization or debugging, fast compilation
    "portable":
      Optimizations which are portable to all CPUs of a given family
    "portable-debug":
      same as above, with debugging information
    "native":
      Optimizations which are specific to the host CPU, non-portable library
    "native-debug":
      same as above, with debugging information
    Default is "native".

- wgridder:
  - more careful treatment of u,v,w-coordinates and phase angles, leading to
    better achievable accuracies for single-precision runs
  - performance improvements by making the computed interval in "n-1" symmetric
    around 0. This reduces the number of required w planed significantly.
    Speedups are bigger for large FOVs and when FFT is dominating.
  - allow working with dirty images that are shifted with respect to the phase
    center. This allows faceting.

- pointingprovider:
  - improved performance via vectorized trigonometric functions


0.7.0:
- general:
  - compilation with MSVC on Windows is now possible

- wgridder:
  - performance (especially scaling) improvements
  - oversampling factors up to 2.5 supported
  - new, more flexible interface in submodule `wgridder.experimental`
    (subject to further changes!)

- totalconvolver:
  - now performs non-equidistant FFT interpolation also in psi direction,
    making it much faster for large kmax.
  - new low-level interface which allows flexible re-distribution of work
    over MPI tasks (responsibility of the caller)


0.6.0:
- general:
  - multi-threading improvements contributed by Peter Bell

- wgridder:
  - new, smaller internal data structure


0.5.0:
- wgridder:
  - internally used grid size is now chosen automatically, and the parameters
    "nu" and "nv" are ignored; they will be removed in ducc1.


0.3.0:
- general:
  - The package should now be installable from PyPI via pip even on MacOS.
    However, MacOS >= 10.14 is required.

- wgridder:
  - very substantial performance and scaling improvements


0.2.0:
- wgridder:
  - kernels are now evaluated via polynomial approximation, allowing much
    more freedom in the choice of kernel function
  - switch to 2-parameter ES kernels for better accuracy
  - unnecessary FFT calculations are skipped

- totalconvolve:
  - improved accuracy by making use of the new wgridder kernels
  - *INTERFACE CHANGE* removed method "epsilon_guess()"

- pointingprovider:
  new, experimental module for computing detector pointings from a time stream
  of satellite pointings. To be used by litebird_sim initially.
